## IDE Quickstart

Click [this](http://homebase.kipr.org/2014/mod/resource/view.php?id=885) for KIPR's workshop slides that has information on the new controller/IDE.

1. Turn on the controller.
2. Connect your computer to the controller via micro-USB.
3. Open a web browser and go here: `192.168.124.1:8888`

> For step 2, you could also use the ethernet connection created by the
> controller, but I haven't had success with that method. Another downside to
> connecting to the controller's network is that you cannot access the internet.

4. Create a project OR edit an existing project.
   - Since you are directly connected, you can view all the existing projects on the controller.
5. `Compile` your project when you're ready.
6. Click on the `Runner` to direct yourself to the console output.
7. `Run` your project either on your computer or manually on the robot.
